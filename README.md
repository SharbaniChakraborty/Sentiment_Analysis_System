# Sentiment_Analysis_System
It is a natural language processing application which can analyze the sentiment on the basis of the text given by the user either through feedback, survey, form etc.
This application (made as part of an online course that I did); can predict the sentiments into 3 categories which are positive, negative and neutral. It can even access the data from a google form through google sheets. It's a web application which can be utilized on a local area network.
